- how to create a dimmer effect when toggling the menu.


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - Using <picture> and srcset attribute.
- [w3docs](https://www.w3docs.com) - HOW TO section: how to overlay images. Great resource to understand how positioning elements.
- [dev.to](https://dev.to/ljcdev/easy-hamburger-menu-with-js-2do0) - This helped me with the hamburguer menu and teach with a very straightforward explanation how to add the toggle functionality with Javascript.
- [freecodecamp blog]("Learn CSS Grid by Building 5 Layouts in 17 minutes") - This is a great source to learn and familiarise yourself with grid layout in a very simple, straight to the point way. As promised, after 17 minutes, you'd have learnt 5 different grid layouts, and will be ready for the challenge.
